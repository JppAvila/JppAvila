- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JppAvila and I'm a junior software developer.

  Here you can find part of the most important projects I did during my time as a student and now, as a software developer, I have been gradually expanding my knowledge in web development. I have been diving deeper into front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also exploring back-end frameworks like Node.js and databases like MongoDB. I have enjoyed working on dynamic web applications and improving user experiences through responsive design and intuitive interfaces. As I continue to grow as a developer, I look forward to taking on new challenges and leveraging my skills to create innovative and impactful web solutions.

You need to have patience, little by little, I will be uploading more small projects.
